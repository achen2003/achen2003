# About Me

I'm Alex Chen, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto

🔭 I’m currently working on System Software Integration @ Ford Motors Canada in Ottawa, Ontario

💻 I'm passionate about learning and working on software/firmware development, especially projects using C/C++ and/or Python 

🌱 Recently, I've learned the basics of OS development as well as network programming

🎸 Outside of school and work, I enjoy practicing electric guitar, listening to a lot of music, watching movies, and picking up new skills
